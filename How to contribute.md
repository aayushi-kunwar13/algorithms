# Contributing Guidelines

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repo üç¥ (and don't forget to star!)

2. Add your implementation of a new algorithm

3. Feel free to create a new issue if you have suggestions for more algorithms.

4. Submit a pull request.


## General guidelines
- When contributing to this repository, please first inform or discuss the change(s) you wish to make via an issue. This helps in letting others know what you're working on.

- Go through the sample folder to understand the expected files and structure

- Use soft tabs that are 4 spaces long [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI :D]

- While solving Trees / Graph problems, make use of the helper functions to flatten and de-flatten the input and make sure that an image of the graph taken as input is added to the repository.

- For each algorithm, mention its **time complexity** and **space complexity** in the _"description comment"_ of its implementation.

    The format for the _"description comment"_ (which is written at the beginning) should be:
    ```
    <Name of algorithm>
    -------------------
    <Brief description>

    Time complexity
    ---------------
    O(...), where <description of variable(s)>    

    Space complexity
    ----------------
    O(...), where <description of variable(s)>
    ```
